# 💬 Companions Anonymous — Concept Note

## 🧠 Problem Statement
When patients visit clinics or hospitals, they are often accompanied by companions — friends, parents, relatives, or caregivers.  
While the patient is inside the doctor’s chamber, the companion is left waiting outside — often experiencing **stress, anxiety, and isolation**.

During this time, companions frequently think:

- How will the treatment go?  
- Is the doctor skilled and friendly?  
- Will it be too costly?  
- How are the hospital staff behaving?  

This idle waiting period is usually spent **scrolling through social media, making phone calls, or worrying**, leading to frustration and emotional fatigue.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To create a **safe, moderated, and anonymous digital space** for companions to engage in **meaningful, supportive discussions** while they wait — reducing stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
**Companions Anonymous** is an **Anonymous Waiting Chat Platform** integrated within healthcare environments such as **clinics, hospitals, and diagnostic centers**.

---

## 🧭 How It Works

### 🧾 Access
- A **QR code** is displayed in the waiting area.  
- Companions **scan the QR code** to open the platform (lightweight PWA or web app).  

---

### 📍 Location Access & Geo-Fencing
- Upon scanning, the system requests **location permission**.  
- Access is granted **only if the user is within 50 meters** of the hospital or clinic.  
- If outside the radius, the system shows a polite message:  
  > “This chat is only available for companions currently at the clinic.”

---

### 🔐 Authentication
- After location validation, users enter their **mobile number**.  
- OTP verification ensures **legitimate, one-time access** and prevents misuse by outsiders.

---

### 👤 Avatar Assignment (Fixed & Visible)
- Instead of real identities, users are automatically assigned a **static avatar** and a **non-editable nickname**.  
- This preserves anonymity while making each participant visible and distinct within the chatroom.

---

### 💬 Chatroom Experience
- Companions are placed into a **location-based chatroom** specific to the hospital or clinic.  
- They can view **previous discussions** and **share experiences** anonymously.  
- All messages pass through an **AI-powered moderation layer** before posting.  
- A **virtual agent** keeps conversations active and meaningful, ensuring that **no one feels ignored**.

---

## 🤖 Simulated Virtual Agent
A built-in **virtual chat agent** participates anonymously (not revealed as a bot).  
It acts as a **gentle facilitator**, helping maintain an active, empathetic, and focused space.

### 🧩 Roles
- Keep conversations alive during quiet periods  
- Provide empathetic, context-aware responses  
- Redirect off-topic or emergency content appropriately  
- Reinforce chatroom relevance (no politics, spam, or ads)

---

### 🧠 Virtual Agent Reply Logic

**Idle Time / No Response**
> If a user message receives no replies for 2–3 minutes  
> 💬 “That’s a good point — many companions here wonder about the same.”

**Trigger Keywords**
- *Doctor behavior*: “Many companions do think about how caring the doctor will be. It’s quite natural.”  
- *Cost/charges*: “Billing transparency is a common concern for patients and families.”  
- *Waiting time*: “Yes, waiting can feel long sometimes. Others here might have similar experiences.”

**Relevance Enforcement**
> “Let’s try to keep this space focused on the waiting experience so it’s helpful for everyone.”

**New User Onboarding**
> “Hi, welcome! Feel free to share your thoughts while you wait — many here might relate.”

**Room Inactivity (10–15 minutes)**
> “How is your waiting experience today? Anything on your mind?”

**Emergency Mentions**
> “If this is an urgent medical issue, please inform the hospital staff right away.”

⚖️ *Key Principle:* The agent should **not dominate** — it gently facilitates, stepping in only when necessary.
